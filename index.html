    <article class="card">
      <p class="scene">Emma and Jack had been dating for two years, long enough to know each other's quirks but not nearly long enough to stop being surprised by them.</p>

      <p>Emma was what Jack politely called a “climate enthusiast.” In less polite terms, she was obsessed with the thermostat. If the temperature went up or down even a single degree, she would notice and declare war on it.</p>

      <p>Jack, on the other hand, was perfectly content to live like a lizard basking on a rock. “Cold is a mindset,” he would often say, as Emma glared at him while shivering in three sweaters.</p>

      <p>The trouble began one Sunday afternoon in their apartment. Emma was curled up on the couch, blanket wrapped around her, sipping tea like a tragic Victorian heroine.</p>

      <p>“It’s freezing in here,” she said, her teeth chattering for dramatic effect.</p>

      <p>Jack, sprawled in a T-shirt and shorts, was happily munching popcorn. “Freezing? Emma, it’s seventy-two degrees. That’s the international temperature of comfort. Scientists probably voted on it.”</p>

      <p>“I don’t care if a panel of Nobel Prize winners voted on it,” Emma said. “It feels like the inside of a refrigerator. Turn it up.”</p>

      <p>Jack reached for the thermostat, paused, and looked at her. “You know this is how civilizations collapse, right? People fighting over resources, power, and… thermostat settings.”</p>

      <p>Emma narrowed her eyes. “Civilizations collapse because men refuse to listen to women who are obviously right.”</p>

      <p>Jack grinned. “Fair point. But I have evidence.” He grabbed his phone and pulled up the weather app. “See? Outside it’s eighty-five. If we raise the thermostat any higher, we’re basically creating a greenhouse. Polar bears will drown because of us.”</p>

      <p>Emma gasped. “Did you just guilt-trip me with polar bears?”</p>

      <p>“Absolutely.”</p>

      <p>She swatted his arm. “Fine, then I’ll save the polar bears. But don’t come crying to me when I turn into an icicle.”</p>

      <p>Later that night, Emma executed her plan. At exactly 2:13 a.m., when Jack was snoring like a chainsaw, she tiptoed out of bed and crept to the thermostat. She raised it two degrees, smiled like a victorious general, and snuck back under the covers.</p>

      <p>What she didn’t know was that Jack had installed a <em>thermostat tracker app</em>. His phone buzzed as soon as she touched it. Half-asleep, he mumbled, “Busted,” and shuffled to reset it.</p>

      <p>The next morning, Emma noticed the betrayal. “Jack. Did you… spy on the thermostat?”</p>

      <p>He rubbed the back of his neck. “Technically, yes. But only because you launched an illegal temperature coup.”</p>

      <p>“That wasn’t a coup, that was survival!”</p>

      <p>From then on, the apartment became a battleground. Emma would raise the temperature by three degrees while cooking dinner, and Jack would sneakily lower it back when she went to the bathroom. Emma started wearing wool socks year-round, while Jack invested in an absurdly large box fan, which hummed like an airplane engine.</p>

      <p>Their friends began to notice. At a game night, Emma sat bundled like she was preparing for an arctic expedition, while Jack looked like he’d just run a marathon in the desert.</p>

      <p>“Are you guys… okay?” one friend asked cautiously.</p>

      <p>“Oh, we’re fine,” Emma said sweetly. “We’re just engaged in a minor domestic disagreement.”</p>

      <p>Jack raised his eyebrows. “Minor? This is the Cold War, babe. Literally.”</p>

      <p>Despite the ongoing battle, they couldn’t help laughing about it. Emma would pretend to faint dramatically every time the thermostat dropped, and Jack would play funeral music on his phone. Jack, on the other hand, sometimes woke up to find Emma had piled three blankets on top of him, “for balance,” she claimed.</p>

      <p>One evening, after another round of thermostat skirmishes, Emma finally said, “You know, normal couples fight about chores or in-laws. We’re going to end up in counseling over degrees Fahrenheit.”</p>

      <p>Jack shrugged. “Better than fighting about who left the dishes in the sink.”</p>

      <p>“True,” Emma admitted. “But I swear, if you freeze me one more time, I’m moving in with my mom.”</p>

      <p>Jack grinned. “And leave me alone with the thermostat? That’s cruel and unusual punishment.”</p>

      <p>Emma stared at him, then burst out laughing. “You’re ridiculous.”</p>

      <p>“Ridiculously warm,” he corrected.</p>

      <p>Finally, they agreed on a truce: the thermostat would stay at seventy-four. Emma got her fuzzy blankets, Jack got his fan, and the polar bears presumably survived.</p>

      <p>But every now and then, in the middle of the night, Jack would hear a faint <em>click</em>. And somewhere in the dark, Emma would whisper, “Victory.”</p>

      <p>And despite himself, Jack would smile. Because he knew that life with Emma—even if it was two degrees warmer than he preferred—was better than any perfectly calibrated thermostat.</p>
